# Use-I2C-LCD-to-make-some-fun-things----A-train-destination-board
I am an enthusiast of the railway. Because of the pandemic, I can't travel to other places by railway. So I decided to make a Train Destination Board by I2C LCD. The format of the information shown on the LCD is referred to as the TRA's format (Taiwan Railway Administration).  It's an easy one. However, I wasted a few hours on improving and troubleshooting the code and the Arduino hardware. I tried to ask in some local Arduino forum in Facebook. However, they had no idea. Finally, I discovered that the problem is poor contact between the wire and the pin on the Arduino UNO. Umm I think it is a signal for me to buy a new UNO board because mine is already 1 decade old...
